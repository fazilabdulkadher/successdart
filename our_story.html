		SuccessDart is born as a bye product of our own need to create a unique and efficient employee appraisal and goal setting process and an underlying tool to support it. Like many organizations, we ( <a href="http://www.ruby-software.com/" target="_blank"> Ruby Software </a>  ) realized the importance of aligning organization’s goals and values with individual employees  own goals. We started with the usual practice of using the .xls file and then quickly realized the inefficiencies, the next option was to contact the HRIS vendor to extend the functionality  to include a super efficient employee performance appraisal and goal setting and tracking functionalities, and retracted when we realized bottlenecks. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Finally we decided to create our own application, and thus SuccessDart was born
		</p>
		<h2>Our Story</h2>
	<p>
We are an emerging IT Boutique, Performance Appraisals were never a concern for us - Until in 2009, we were small and nimble with paper evaluations doing the rounds. When we grew our business we found that the HR folks are having a difficulty in managing and coordinating the appraisal process. Furthermore, the employees -particularly the managers were finding the paper evaluations cumbersome. The need for a better Employee Appraisal system had arisen.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the years that followed, we moved on to the shared spread sheet approach to employee appraisals. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Though less frustrating than the paper evaluations, the appraisal process was far from "enjoyable" - we were left with constant IT support, scalability issues and an unhappy work force. 
		</p>
		<p>
		This is the part where the plot thickens. 
		</p>
		<p>
		We looked around for help and what we found was disconcerting- a vast majority of organizations had no proper EmployeeAppraisal mechanism in place. And the ones that did have them were 1.either stuck at the same place we were  back then or 2.where in even more graver situations- tinkering with HRIS -Bolt ons and In-House solutions. And not to mention those organizations who had lost faith in the very process of Employee Appraisal but do namesake evaluations nevertheless! 
		</p>
		<p>
		The NEED for an innovative Employee Appraisal system had arisen.
		</p>
		<p>
		We also realized that the PROBLEM was not with the process of Employee Appraisals but with the means of  IMPLEMENTING it.  Being natural problem solvers - we decided to take on the challenge.
		</p>
		<p>
		And now, 2 years later after careful Research, innumerable conversations with HR personnel and Experts we would like to invite you to explore our solution  - Like us, this tool will help you to implement Employee Appraisal at your work place and make that journey enjoyable.
