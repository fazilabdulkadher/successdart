		<h2>SuccessDart for your Success</h2>
It does not matter whether you are a Private company, a Government institution or a Non Profit Organization – SuccessDart can definitely help you to increase the performance level of your employees.
Any organization may be more loosely understood as the planned, coordinated and purposeful action of human beings working through collective action to reach a common goal or construct a tangible product. 
<h2>The Organization </h2>
The Organization would have a long term objective or Vision which it seeks to achieve. To make the vision a reality, strategies are adopted. A strategy comprises a set of activities to be performed and results to be obtained. We call these activities and results - ‘Goals’. Goals are distributed among the employees.
<h2>Employees</h2>
Employees work under contract or service in return for payment from the organization. An Employee contributes to the organization’s growth by accomplishing his/her goals.
 <h2>Now let us look at what happens in most organizations</h2>
In most organizations, the organization Vision is clearly defined, so are the strategies for achieving it. However, it is in the division of strategy into goals and allocation of these goals objectively to each employee that most organizations fall short. 
Most organizations fail in:
<ul>
<li>Creating objective and quantifiable goals</li>
<li>Effectively mapping these goals to individual employees</li>
<li>Tracking these goals on a regular basis</li>
<li>Updating and revising goals</li>
<li>Creating specific evaluation characteristics for every employee</li>
<li>Reviewing accomplished goals and performance criteria’s</li>
</ul>
Success Dart is designed to address these inefficiencies. Most appraisals fall short because they do not have an <b>Efficient Framework </b>where they can perform the said operations. 
This is where we can help you. We can help you automate and streamline the process
We can give you the ability to:
<ul>
<li>Define Goals for each and every Employee</li> 
<li>Create Evaluation Criteria for every  single employee</li>
<li>Monitor and measure Evaluations and Goals</li>
<li>Ensure Feedback and review between Managers and Employees </li>             
</ul>
